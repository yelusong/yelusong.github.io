            Jeffrey Lynn Koons born in 21 January 1955, is an American artist
             recognized for his work dealing with po-pular culture and his sculptures 
             depicting everyday o-bjects, including balloon animals produced in stainle-ss 
             steel with mirror finish surfaces.
          </p>
          <p class="p1">Born in York, Pennsylvania, Jeff Koons rose to promi-nence in the mid-1980s 
            as part of a generation of arti-sts who explored the meaning of art in a 
            media satur-ated era. He gained recognition in the 1980s and su-bsequently 
            set up a factory-like studio in a SoHo loft on the corner of Houston Street 
            and Broadway in Ne-w York. </p>

            In order to support himself during his early years in college, Koons would go to the 
            MoMA every day in order to ask if there <br>were any job openings available for him.
            Finally, the opportunity was given to him asthey needed someone on the member- <br>ship 
            desk. Besides interacting with people, Koons was able to study
             the collection and meet lots of other young artists.
             He <br>now resides and works in both New York City and 
            his hometown of York, Pennsylvania. His works 
            have sold for substantial<br> sums, including at 
            least two record auction prices for a work by a 
            living artist. Koons continues to create art and has no pla-<br>ns 
          to lay down his material any time soon.
