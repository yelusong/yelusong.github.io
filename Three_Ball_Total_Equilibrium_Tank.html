            A state of equilibrium is when something is in perfect balance. <br>
            The basket balls float in what seems an unnatural state most <br> people have a hard time of comprehending. However, the balls
             <br>are not in a state of perfect equilibrium as the balls sink to the <br>bottom of the tank over time.
            This is however something that <br> would be hidden to the viewer unless one would revisit it over <br>time. The artist himself claims that the work is a representation <br>
            of death as the ultimate state of being.
